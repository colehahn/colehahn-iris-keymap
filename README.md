# colehahn-iris-keymap

This repo holds the description of my custom keyboard layout for my keyboard, which is a Keebio Iris Rev 5. \

To be used properly with QMK, this repository should be nested like so: `qmk_firmware\keyboards\keebio\iris\keymaps\colehahn`. \

Once I have things more how I want them, I can include images/description of my keymap here. \
