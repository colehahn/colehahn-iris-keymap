# colehahn-iris-keymap

This repo holds the description of my custom keyboard layout for my keyboard, which is a Keebio Iris Rev 5. \

To be used properly with QMK, this repository should be nested like so: `qmk_firmware\keyboards\keebio\iris\keymaps\colehahn`. \

Cool features:

- Shift key is hold for shift, tap cor caps_word, and double tap for caps lock
- leds indicate current layer

Things I want to add:

- scrolling for using mouse
- swap hands for when using mouse
- dynamic macros? have leds indicate when recording, etc
- add screenshot of layers to README
